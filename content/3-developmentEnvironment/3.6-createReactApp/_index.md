In this section, we will deploy a simple React application. Cloud9 provides us with all the necessary libraries to do this without requiring any additional installations.

1. Execute the following commands to create the project:
```shell
mkdir my-react-app
cd my-react-app
npx create-react-app .
npm start
```
